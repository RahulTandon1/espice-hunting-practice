so, the aim was to make a site where kids can make their own hunt levels, get a url for the same and
share it with others for them to solve. Said URLs would have a somewhat hunt interface, which basically 
means the ability to check one's answer. 

Right now, the problem is with pug compiling and my css and js not being included. 
chrome throws an HTML error. 

in terms of functionality left to add, I just need to add code in the script.js file for
the basicLevel.pug to get the 'endpoint' by parsing the url. I have figured the code for that somewhat.
